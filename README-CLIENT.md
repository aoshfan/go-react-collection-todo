# EXPLAIN
This code snippet is a React component written in TypeScript, and it uses several libraries including Mantine (a UI library), Octicons (a set of icons from GitHub), and SWR (a React hook library for data fetching). Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Imports and Component Setup**:
    - `Box`, `List`, and `ThemeIcon` are imported from `@mantine/core`. These are UI components.
    - `CheckCircleFillIcon` is imported from `@primer/octicons-react` for iconography.
    - `useSWR` is a React hook for data fetching, imported from `swr`.
    - `AddTodo` is a custom React component, presumably for adding new todos.
    - The `App.css` file is imported for styling.

2. **Type Definition (`Todo`) and Endpoint Configuration**:
    - An interface `Todo` is defined with properties `id`, `title`, `body`, and `done`.
    - A constant `ENDPOINT` is set to a URL, which is the base path for the API.

3. **Data Fetching Function (`fetcher`)**:
    - A `fetcher` function is defined to fetch data from a given URL. It concatenates the `ENDPOINT` with a specified path and returns the JSON response.

4. **The `App` Component**:
    - The `useSWR` hook is used to fetch data from the `"api/todos"` endpoint. It returns `data` (the fetched todos) and `mutate`, a function to mutate the local data.
    - `markTodoAdDone` is an asynchronous function to mark a todo as done. It sends a PATCH request to update a todo's status and then mutates the local data with the updated todo list.

5. **Rendering**:
    - The component returns a `Box` component, which is a styled div with specific padding, width, and margin.
    - Inside the `Box`, there is a `List`, which iterates over each todo in the `data` array. Each `List.Item` represents a todo.
    - Each `List.Item`:
        - Is clickable and will invoke `markTodoAdDone` with the todo's id.
        - Displays the todo's title.
        - Uses a `ThemeIcon` to show a checkmark icon, colored differently based on whether the todo is marked as done.
    - An `AddTodo` component is included, which presumably allows the user to add new todos. It receives `mutate` as a prop, allowing it to update the list of todos after adding a new one.

6. **Possible Error**:
    - There seems to be a typo in the URL in `markTodoAdDone`: `"api/todosn/${id}/done"`. It should probably be `"api/todos/${id}/done"`.

Overall, this component represents a simple todo application interface, allowing users to view a list of todos, mark them as done, and add new todos. The use of `useSWR` for data fetching provides a convenient way to handle server state with local UI state updates.


## function App()
This code snippet is part of a React component named `App`. Let's go through it line by line:

1. `function App() {`:
   - This line defines a function component in React named `App`.

2. `const { data, mutate } = useSWR<Todo[]>("api/todos", fetcher);`:
   - `useSWR` is a React hook used for data fetching. It is being used here to fetch a list of todo items.
   - `Todo[]` indicates that the expected return type of the data fetched is an array of `Todo` items.
   - `"api/todos"` is the API endpoint from which the data is being fetched.
   - `fetcher` is the function that `useSWR` will use to fetch the data.
   - The hook returns an object containing `data` (the fetched data) and `mutate` (a function to mutate the data).

3. `async function markTodoAdDone(id: number) {`:
   - This line begins the definition of an asynchronous function named `markTodoAdDone`, which takes a single argument `id` of type `number`.

4. `const updated = await fetch(`${ENDPOINT}/api/todosn/${id}/done`, { method: "PATCH", }).then((r) => r.json());`:
   - This line sends an HTTP PATCH request to a specific URL to mark a todo as done.
   - `ENDPOINT` is a base URL, and `id` is the ID of the todo item.
   - The response from the fetch request is converted to JSON format and stored in `updated`.

5. `mutate(updated);`:
   - This line calls the `mutate` function with the updated data. It is used to update the local data without needing to re-fetch from the server.

6. `return (`:
   - This line starts the JSX return statement for the React component.

7. `<Box sx={(theme) => ({ padding: "2rem", width: "100%", maxWidth: "40rem", margin: "0 auto", })} >`:
   - This JSX tag renders a `Box` component (from Mantine UI library), styled with padding, width, maximum width, and margin.

8. `<List spacing="xs" size="sm" mb={12} center>`:
   - Inside the `Box`, a `List` component is rendered with specific spacing, size, margin-bottom, and centered items.

9. `{data?.map((todo) => {`:
   - This line uses the `map` function to iterate over each item in `data` (the fetched list of todos). The `?` is used for optional chaining, which means this code will only execute if `data` is not null or undefined.

10. `return (`:
    - Starts the return statement inside the map function.

11. `<List.Item onClick={() => markTodoAdDone(todo.id)} key={`todo_list__${todo.id}`} icon={...}> {todo.title} </List.Item>`:
    - This renders a `List.Item` for each todo.
    - `onClick` calls `markTodoAdDone` with the todo's id when the item is clicked.
    - `key` is a unique identifier required by React for items in a list.
    - `icon` displays a different icon depending on whether the todo is marked as done.
    - `{todo.title}` displays the title of the todo.

12. `});`:
    - Closes the map function.

13. `</List>`:
    - Closes the `List` component.

14. `<AddTodo mutate={mutate} />`:
    - This line includes the `AddTodo` component, passing `mutate` as a prop. This component is likely used to add new todo items.

15. `</Box>`:
    - Closes the `Box` component.

16. `};`:
    - Closes the `App` function.

In summary, this `App` component fetches a list of todo items from an API, displays them in a list, allows marking them as done, and includes functionality to add new todos. The use of `useSWR` for data fetching simplifies the process of fetching, updating, and revalidating the data.
