This code snippet defines a React functional component named `AddTodo`, which is used for adding new todo items. Let's break down the code:

1. **Imports**:
    - `useState` is imported from `react` for managing component state.
    - `useForm` is imported from `@mantine/hooks`, a Mantine library hook for form handling.
    - UI components (`Button`, `Modal`, `Group`, `TextInput`, `Textarea`) are imported from `@mantine/core`.
    - `ENDPOINT` and the `Todo` type are imported from `../App`, likely representing the API endpoint and the todo item structure.
    - `KeyedMutator` is imported from `swr`, a type definition related to the SWR data fetching library.

2. **Component Definition**:
    - `AddTodo` is a function component that accepts a prop named `mutate`, which is a `KeyedMutator` for an array of `Todo` items.

3. **Component State**:
    - `useState(false)` initializes a state variable `open` to control the visibility of the modal.

4. **Form Handling**:
    - `useForm` is used to handle form state and validation. It initializes with empty `title` and `body` fields.

5. **Function `createTodo`**:
    - This is an asynchronous function that takes `values` (containing `title` and `body`) as an argument.
    - It sends a POST request to the server (using `fetch` and the `ENDPOINT`) to create a new todo, with the form values as the request body.
    - The response is expected in JSON format (`r.json()`).
    - After the new todo is created, `mutate` is called to update the local data, `form.reset()` clears the form, and `setOpen(false)` closes the modal.

6. **Rendering**:
    - The component returns a fragment (`<>...</>`).
    - Inside the fragment, a `Modal` component is rendered, which opens based on the `open` state. The modal includes a form for creating a todo.
    - `TextInput` and `Textarea` components are used for the title and body fields of the form, with `form.getInputProps` binding their values and events.
    - A `Button` within the form triggers the `createTodo` function on submit.
    - Outside the modal, a `Group` component containing another `Button` is used to open the modal (`setOpen(true)`).

7. **Export**:
    - `AddTodo` is exported as the default export of this module.

In summary, the `AddTodo` component allows users to input a title and body for a new todo item and submit it to a server. Upon successful creation, it updates the local todo list and clears the form. The component uses Mantine for UI components, SWR for state management, and React's `useState` for local state control.
